### Rules of the game
The game is very simple. You play as the character "PacMan".
In order to win you have to eat all the "food" on the game board.
While you're eating the food, there might be some dangers.
And those dangers are called "ghosts".
Ghosts fly around the board and if they catch you, they eat you.
Simple as that. So, don't get caught by ghosts and eat all the food.
Then you're definitely going to win.
